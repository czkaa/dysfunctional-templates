    <h3 class="text-md filter-outline-xs mt-16 mb-3">Collective Project: <br>(Dys)functional Templates </h3>
    <p class="block">
      For the next three sessions, we want to further question conventions of the web. The visuality and functionality of templates builders will be the start of our joint project. In conducting small code and thought experiments, we will approximate our own, antagonistic version of the functional template: We will code our own alternative, commenting version of:
      <ol>
         <li>headers</li>
         <li>footers</li>
         <li>menus</li>
         <li>galleries</li>
         <li>buttons</li>
         <li>testimonials</li>
         <li>contact forms</li>
         <li>FAQ sections</li>
         <li>grids</li>
      </ol> 
      <br>

Your contribution to our collective project may be a whole collection, it may be only one super cute button. Do as you please – we ask you to create at least one personal interpretation of one of these elements (of course you can add other elements to the list).
Finally, all of your approaches will be presented in a collective website: We will develop a shop-like interface where you can buy (download for free) the new, alternative elements which you came up with, offering our criticism, questioning or endorsement of template culture. 




<div class="border border-secondary p-3 my-3 mx-6 rounded-md">
      <ol class="list-decimal px-6 space-y-2">
         <p class="mb-2">To help you get started, we came up with a number of steps which will be helpful to develop your own approach:</p>
            <li>Pick an element/or multiple of the list(above) we provided.</li>
            <li>Get to know the element, how it works, how you perceive it, why it exits. You can research online or ask yourself:
               <small class="leading-none block my-2">
               <ol class="list-disc ml-4">
                  <li>Where does it come from? What is it standard purpose? </li>
                  <li>How does it work?</li>
                  <li>On what kind of website do you usually find it?</li>
                  <li>How does it usually look like?</li>
                  <li>Is there a reoccurring text layer? What kind of content does it usually display? </li>
               </ol></small>
            </li>
            <li>Find your own approach to the element(s) of your choice – your own version of it, your response to the corporate, all-about-the-money, super-efficient, as-easy-as-possible notion that dominates the current web.
               <small class="leading-none block my-2"><ol class="list-disc ml-4">
                  <li>What do you like about it? What don't you like about it? </li>
                  <li>What questions would you like to ask it? </li>
                  <li>In which cases is it actually necessary? When is it superfluous?</li>
                  <li>What could an alternative text layer entail?</li>
                  <li>What is an alternative visuality or interaction which could be applied to the element?</li>
               </ol>
               Other things to consider:
               The relation between functionality and efficiency
               The relation between hand-made and machine-made 
               The relation between placeholder texts and content
               The relation between commerce and availability</small>
            </li>
            <li>Write down a concept. We would like you to come up with one very spontaneous, first-idea, on-top-of-your-mind concept. Basically, your element should tell a little story beyond its usual functionality. One sentence or maybe only a title might be enough. 
               <small class="leading-none block my-2"><ol class="list-disc ml-4">
                  <li>It can be very conceptual like:   creating 50 buttons with chat gtp</li>
                  <li>or visual like:     a header that looks like a 100$ bill</li>
                  <li>or theoretical like:    an FAQ section that raises questions but does not present any answers </li>
                  <li>or interactive like:   a contact form that keeps changing it's input all the time </li>
                  <li>or even text-based like:   an image slider containing an essay why everything should or should not look the same</li>
                  </ol></small>
</li>
<li>Start to visualize your concept by making a pen and paper sketch.</li>
<li>Realize your concept using code. You can find starterkits for each of the elements in our <a href="https://www.are.na/karen-czock/dt-starterkits" target="_blank">are.na starterkits channel</a>. You can of course also start from scratch! You can focus on adding elements and text with HTML, changing the style using CSS or even start to play around with javascript.</li>
        </ol>
